# About This Repository

This repository exists solely for the purpose of deploying my Streamlit app on Streamlit Cloud. When connecting a GitHub account to Streamlit Cloud, Streamlit requires read/write access to all my public and private repositories. To avoid granting such broad permissions to my main GitHub account, I have created this separate account containing only the source code for my Streamlit app.

The actual project repository and documentation are hosted on my [main GitHub account](https://github.com/kanad13/RAGify).

You can find more details about this Streamlit/Github limitation [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/status) and [limitations in the GitHub API](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/4344).
